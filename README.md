# Hand Gesture Recognition 
Project Overview
This project focuses on hand gesture recognition using computer vision techniques to detect a hand in real-time and count the number of fingers raised. The system is capable of recognizing different gestures based on the number of extended fingers, providing a natural and intuitive way for human-computer interaction.

Key Features
Hand Detection: Uses OpenCV and Haar cascades to detect the presence of a hand.
Finger Counting: Identifies the number of fingers raised by analyzing the handâ€™s contours and defects.
Real-Time Processing: Works with a live camera feed to recognize gestures dynamically.
Gesture-Based Interaction: Can be extended to control applications or devices based on different finger counts.
Technology Used
OpenCV: For image processing and hand detection.
Haar Cascades: For detecting the hand.
Contour Analysis: To determine the number of fingers raised.
Python: As the programming language for implementing the algorithm.
Applications
Human-Computer Interaction: Use finger gestures to control a computer or application.
Sign Language Recognition: Can be extended for recognizing sign language gestures.
Gaming & Robotics: Implement hand-based controls for interactive applications.
